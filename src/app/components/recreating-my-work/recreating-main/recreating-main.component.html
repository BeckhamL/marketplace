    <p>
      Ministry is service. To those who follow Jesus, ministry is never just
      about what we do inside a church.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we take our work as ministry, we serve people and God through our
      daily activities in the marketplace. We strive to do the maximum good
      using finite resources. We move by faith trusting that God is with us. We
      bless people through prayer. We Exceed client expectations. We cultivate
      positive relationships.
    </p>
    <p>It begins with blessing people and places.</p>
