      Your situation may seem otherwise right now. You may see yourself as a

      your best smile for customers. You may be looking for a job, or pondering
      a new career, or even asking God to lead you into the clergy. You may be
      seeking a new direction. But God says you are His masterpiece, and you are
      destined to take part in His amazing work (Ephesians 2:10). As long as you
      are in the marketplace, you need to discover your unique role and make a
      difference.

        教會在我家。教會在職場。教會遍天下//
        如果有一天，教會不能再公開聚集敬拜，你會怎樣？萬一北美社會氣候起變化，基督徒遭打壓，我們怎樣繼續牧養傳道？
        疫症爆發，加拿大進入緊急狀態。教會與其他宗教團體被列為“非必要服務”（non-essential），全部關閉。在公眾衛生、國民安全大前提下，教堂關門；
        這屬無可厚非，卻叫人不能不反思，教會在世人眼中的地位，信仰真的可有可無嗎？教會和宗教聚會，真的是“非必要”嗎？
        在宗教信仰受監察的國家，不願向政權低頭的基督徒，早已習慣了沒有實體教堂，轉而在家裡或不同地點聚集。
        顯然，這些在逆境中的弟兄姊妹，絕對認為信仰是必要的！因此，他們在崇拜、教導、訓練、傳道，甚至睦鄰關顧各方面，都因應環境而靈活變化。
        估計華基教會有不少肢體曾參加地下教會，能夠提出詳細見證。

        I’ve been a storyteller all my working life. While studying mass
        communication in Hong Kong, I was thrust into the world of television as
        a documentary translator and narrator. Soon I found myself anchoring
        weekend TV newscasts while working as reporter and then editor for a
        trade journal. Introverted by nature, I never enjoyed life under the
        public eye, but somehow the limelight caught up with me even after I
        landed in Canada in 1993. Omni-TV took me on as program host and
        producer. This was what I did until 2004 – telling stories about other
        people and their business.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="general_text">
        But God had other ideas. Baptized as an infant and raised in the
        Anglican tradition, I encountered Jesus again in 1995. Over the years,
        Jesus has reshaped my story. Life no longer comprises merely existing,
        having fun and delaying the inevitable end, but also interacting with
        the God who loves me as His child. He has a purpose for me, just as He
        does for every human being on earth regardless of age, sex, ethnicity,
        background, and circumstances.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="general_text">
        I left Omni in 2004 and took a one-year sabbatical to seek my next
        steps. I was burdened with telling people how their lives would be
        transformed if only they allowed Jesus to intervene. The following year
        I started as a local church pastor. My primary mission then and now
        remains the same:
        <i>to help people discover meaning, motivation and mission at work. </i>
