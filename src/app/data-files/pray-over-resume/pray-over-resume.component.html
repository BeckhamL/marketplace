  <p class="content">
    Your resume is a great way to review the positives in your career, though
    there may be details and episodes you’d rather not reveal to your next
    employer. We recommend you use your most up-to-date version.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    The sample resume below gives you some idea how to work through the items.
    Obviously, the longer you have been working and studying, the more entries
    you’ll have listed. Take time to reflect on the people you worked with, the
    kind of work you did, the new skills you learned, the benefits that came
    with the job, and the downsides.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    Pray as you begin:
    <i
      >“Father, you know every thought that crosses my mind, and every deed I
      ever committed. Reveal to me both my strengths and weaknesses, that I may
      be restored for better service in the marketplace and to You. In Jesus’
      name, Amen.</i
